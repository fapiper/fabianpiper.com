# Secrets Configuration
# This file is imported by stack configurations to provide structure
# but secrets are NOT defined globally to avoid passing them to all components
#
# Best Practice: Define secrets directly in each component's vars section
# Reference environment variables using ${TF_VAR_*} syntax in component definitions
#
# This approach:
# - Prevents warnings about undeclared variables
# - Gives each component only what it needs
# - Makes dependencies clear
# - Follows Atmos best practices

# No global vars defined here - secrets are referenced per-component in stack files
